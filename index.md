Sonic Bloom will be in attendance for this year's Purple Monkey Game Jam to provide attendees early access to a beta build of their new technology, Koreographer.  Koreographer is a Unity plugin that enables game developers to synchronize and choreograph anything in their game to music: animations, sound effects, and even gameplay logic!  From simple effects such as HUDs that bounce along to the music to complex scenarios where the music affects how high a player can jump and how fast they can run, Koreographer makes it trivial!

Check out Koregrapher's website [here](http://www.koreographer.com/) for
more info.
