We did it once, we're doing it again. The Purple Monkey Game Jam is back and better than ever! Come out and join us us for an entire weekend of making games, playing games, talking about games ... just generally game-oriented festivities all around. It's going to be great!

Just like last time, we'll be taking theme submissions from now until February 20th, and we will unveil the winner the first day of the event. Participants will then have the entire weekend to make a game, from scratch, based on the winning theme.

Free registration for the event is being done through our [EventBrite page](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/purple-monkey-game-jam-ii-the-gamening-tickets-10123574885). Remember to [submit your theme ideas here](/theme-submission/) before February 20th!

Any questions, feel free to email us: [boston-game-jam@cantina.co](mailto:boston-game-jam@cantina.co)
