title: Intro to Game Jams - Anyone Can Make a Game
year: 2014

Everyone loves playing video games - but what about making them? My brother and I have created and released two iOS games to date, the most recent one being [Colliding Forces](http://www.collidingforcesgame.com/) (a two player tabletop iPad game). In my experience, game design is one of the most rewarding creative activities I've ever participated in. Unlike with many other activities, when you are done you can actually play with your creation. It takes on a life of it's own. 

You might think it takes special training or a certain background to make games, but the truth is that anyone can do it. One of the best ways of starting is by participating in a game jam. In case you're unfamiliar with them, a game jam is an event where participants gather to build rough video games from scratch in a set amount of time, often based on some agreed upon theme. In the game jams I've participated in the limit has been 48 hours. The rules vary, depending on the specific event, but the core challenge is always the same: see what you can produce a short amount of time. 

A game jam is an excellent environment to get started with game development for few reasons:

## You are surrounded by friendly people who can help
There a lot of different people at a game jam: beginners, hobbyists, and professionals. You can use this community to get advice on building your game. In exchange, you can also provide valuable game play feedback to other participants. This resource is invaluable and hard to substitute when you're developing on your own.

## You are timeboxed, which forces you to make pragmatic choices
A common first approach to making games is to first plan out a big vision and then build it. This may sound like a good idea, but it turns out to be rather inefficient. You can unintentionally sign yourself up for months of work on an idea that you aren't sure is going to be fun. Staying motivated through that effort can be difficult.

In a game jam you have limited time to make a game; you need to stick to a process that is more pragmatic. You can start with a vision but you must quickly learn to be flexible with your vision, allowing your project to frequently change direction and take a path with less resistance. When I've participated in game jams, I've found the most efficient process is iterative: plan a small effort (as small as a half hour), build it, play it, brainstorm, repeat. Learning a process like this alone made participating in a game jam worth it for me.

## You are rewarded with a finished game that you created
When you are learning a new creative skill, one of the most encouraging things is generating something tangible. Game jams give you this. When you participate you will walk away with something *playable*. This is a much more certain outcome than starting out on your own with no guidelines, no pressure, and no in-person help. Once you make your first game, you will have all of the basic experience to do it again!

Game jams are an invaluable tool for learning how to make games, but they are also a lot of fun. There are few activities that give you such a major return on your time investment.
