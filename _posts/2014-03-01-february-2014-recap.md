# February 2014 Recap (Theme - "You Win! ...Now What?")

The turnout for the February 2014 game jam was fantastic! Thank you for everyone that attended. Here is a brief recap of the games (publicly available through <https://github.com/purplemonkeygamejam/purplemonkeygamejam-feb-2014/network>) created during this game jam.

## You Win! ...Now What?

You've rescued the kingdom (well, sort of). You've saved your beloved (if only you were theirs).

You killed to do so. You spent every penny you had and you lied, cheated, looted, stole, and even part-timed as an assassin to attain even more to spend.

You made a lot of new enemies and, now that you're out of the limelight, I'm not sure they'll hold back.

You were hailed as the hero, but that didn't last.
You were given medals and acclaim, but those didn't pay for food.

Now you're just trying to survive.
Get money. Get food. Get water.
You've gone through too much to die destitute.

## Super Mario Corpse

A darker look into the world of Mario, Super Mario Corpse explores the thin separation between life, death, and destruction. Playing as a recently failed and supposedly deceased Mario, you attempt to make your way to the surface through a densely packed grave of those who have perished after you and other undead foes seeking you for revenge.
