title: The Purple Monkey Game Jam Anti-Harassment Policy
---

The Purple Monkey Game Jam is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of game jam participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time during the event. Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the game jam and barred from attending future events.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the game jam organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the game jam. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer immediately. Event organizers can be identified with event name badges.

The event organizers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the game jam. We value your attendance.
