    <p>The Purple Monkey Game Jam is a theme-based, non-competitive game jam spanning a full weekend where game makers can come together to practice their craft and learn from each other. A surprise theme will be announced at the beginning of the event and participants can then find a team or work alone to build a game based on the theme by the end of the weekend.</p>
